## NewsAPI
For free, developer plan the content is cut after 260 characters.
With a paid plan, you get the whole article.

Details:
```
    - content - string
    - The unformatted content of the article, where available. This is truncated to 260 chars for Developer plan users.
    - So all the content is restricted to only 260 characters. However, test$url has the link of the source article which you can use to scrape the entire content but since it is being aggregated from various sources I don't think there is one automated way to do this.
